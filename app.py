# üîÆ Comparing Oracles
üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Written by: Christopher Pondoc

This project analyzes different oracles within the world of blockchain development through a data science lens.
By observing and comparing various relevant metrics of oracles, I was able to gain some reasonable comprehension about
the world of crypto more practically.

*Note: Streamlit data app may take a few seconds to load in data from Ethereum Mainnet!*

## üìö **Background**
Developing on the blockchain starts with smart contracts, which are self-operating computer programs, which live on the blockchain and execute
when a certain amount of conditions are met [1]. Despite the many advantages of smart contracts, one limiting factor is the inability to get data from
outside of the blockchain onto the blockchain. Such data can include information about the weather, random numbers, or price feeds of different currencies.

This is where oracles come in: these mechanisms help to retrieve data from off the blockchain for smart contracts to use for dispensing money, making decisions,
and more [2]. In this specific report, we'll be looking at oracles and price feed                        data, and u                         nderstanding how different oracles perform compared to one another.

### **Specific Oracles**
In the case of this task, we'll be focusing on the following oracles:
* Tellor [3]
* Chainlink [4]
* Band Protocol [5]
* DIA [6]
"""

"""

## üíª  **Process**
The first step is to grab pertinent data from each of the oracles. In this case, I followed a specific process:


1. First, I found the address of each oracle's smart contract on the blockchain. For the most part, all the oracles provided
the address to their smart contract through the documentation on their website.

2. After finding the addresses of each smart contract, I went to EtherScan, and downloaded each contract's Application Binary
Interface, or ABI [7]. Since smart contracts are stored and compiled in the blockchain as bytecode, in order to communicate with a smart
contract, we must use an ABI to determine which functions I can invoke as well as what format data will be returned to me [8].

3. Finally, using `web3.py`, I was able to connect each of the project's smart contract, invoke the proper arguments, and then calculate
the metrics accordingly [9].

Below is a code sample that can be used as a template for connecting to a smart contract using `web3.py`. More code samples can be found
in the `scripts` folder in the main repository [10]:

```
from web3 import Web3
import json

f = open('path/to/abi', 'r')
abi = json.load(f)
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/PROJECT_URL'))
address = 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
f.close()
return web3.eth.contract(address=address, abi=abi)
```

"""

## üìä **Data Analysis**
### üíµ **Price Feeds**
The first data I looked at were simply the pure price feeds, mainly focusing on conversions between certain large cryptocurrencies.

Specifically, I decided to key in on the following conversions:
* BTC/USD
* ETH/USD
* AMPL/USD

For each oracle, I utilizes the below functions from their ABIs:
* Tellor: `getCurrentValue(uint256 _requestId)`
* Chainlink: `latestRoundData()`
* Band Protocol: `getReferenceData(string _base, string _quote)`
* DIA: `getCoinInfo(string name)`

Below is a table of initial results. Note that for the Band Protocol, I had a bit of trouble communicating with their
smart contract to get the values for AMPL, so I marked it as `-1`.
"""

# Coins, oracles, and timespans to look at!
coins = ["BTC", "ETH", "AMPL"]
oracle_names = ["Tellor", "Chainlink", "Band Protocol", "DIA"]
timespans = [80, 80, 8]

# Dataframe for the Oracle
oracles = pd.DataFrame({
    'Name': [],
    'BTC/USD': [],
    'ETH/USD': [],
    'AMPL/USD': [],
})

# Getting data for Chainlink
oracles.loc[len(oracles.index)] = ['Chainlink'] +  scripts.chainlink.grab_feeds()

# Getting data for Tellor
tellor_contract = scripts.tellor.set_up_contract()
oracles.loc[len(oracles.index)] = ['Tellor'] + scripts.tellor.grab_feeds()

dia_data = ['DIA']

    dia_data.append(scripts.dia.return_price(coins[i]))

    band_data.append(scripts.band.return_prices(coins[i]))
oracles.loc[len(oracles.index)] = band_data + [-1]

# Display data as a table
st.table(oracles)

"""

### üè∑ **Change in Price Feed over Time**
The next metric I decided to look at was the change in value over time of a certain cryptocurrency. Due to the limitations
of specific oracles and their smart contracts, I was able to grab historical data from only Tellor and Chainlink.

As a general methodology, I first grabbed the latest request for a value for each price feed. For both Tellor and Chainlink,
the respective functions from the respective ABIs returned round IDs. Thus, by subtracting 1 for each previous round, I was able
to iterate over the previous 5 days by grabbing the value of a price feed at a specific ID or timestamp.

Below are the functions I utilized from each ABI:
* Tellor: `getDataBefore(uint256 _requestId, uint256 _timestamp)`
* Chainlink: `getRoundData(uint80 _roundId)`

*Note: Horizontal Axis is Request #, Vertical Axis is Price in USD*

"""

# Looking at all of the data, and then getting those values
for i in range(0, len(coins)):
    tellor_prices = scripts.tellor.get_better_price(coins[i] + "/USD", timespans[i])
    chainlink_prices = scripts.chainlink.get_better_price(coins[i] + "/USD", timespans[i])
    coin_df = pd.DataFrame({
        'Tellor': tellor_prices,
        'Chainlink': chainlink_prices
    })
    st.markdown('** Graph of Value of ' + coins[i] + '/USD **')
    st.line_chart(coin_df)

"""
***
### ‚è± **Average Time Between Each Request**
Next, I decided to investigate the time that it took to satisfy each request for the updated value of a price
feed. Between requests, I would calculate the time difference between the Unix timestamps of when the value was previously
updated to when the next requested was started.

*Note: Horizontal Axis is Request #, Vertical Axis is Time in Seconds*

### üìà **Histogram of Time**
Note that due the economics of tokens like Tellor, looking at absolute speed is not the most important metric. If anything, a lack of erraticness + a commitment to 
consistency is much more consequential. Thus, in addition to looking at time per request over time + averages, one could also plot the distribution as a histogram
and analyze the standard deviation.

***
### ‚õΩÔ∏è **Gas Prices**
The final metric I decided to investigate involved analyzing the gas estimates for retrieving data from each specific oracle.
Simply put, gas refers to the cost needed in order to perform a transaction on a blockchain network. Transactions fees are
equal to the product of the units of gas used and the price per unit. However, the units of gas is ultimately fixed [11]. In order
to calculate each gas price, I utilized the `estimate_gas()` function within `web3.py`.

It's also important to note that the amount of gas required is also highly dependent on the amount of data being sent back
from the smart contract and the function being called.

Key:
* 0 - Tellor
* 1 - Chainlink
* 2 - DIA
* 3 - Band Protocol
